# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts student academic performance using machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
To predict a student's final score based on study hours, attendance, and previous academic performance.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Performed data preprocessing
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained a regression model
- Evaluated the model using performance metrics

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand how to apply machine learning concepts to real-world educational data.
